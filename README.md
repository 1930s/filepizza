## Overview

FilePizza enables fast and private peer-to-peer file transfers in your web browser.

By using [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org), FilePizza eliminates the initial upload traditionally required when sharing files via file sharing services (e.g. Dropbox). Instead of transmitting files through an intermediary server, the sender initializes a transfer and receives a "tempalink" they can distribute. When recipients click on this link, they connect directly to the senderâ€™s browser to complete the download. Because the file never touches the server, the transfer is fast, private, and secure. For larger files, this is an especially big deal.

## Usage

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

## Requirements

* node `0.12.x`
* npm `2.x.x`

## Troubleshooting

If you receive a `Error: EMFILE, too many open files` error when running `npm
start` on a Mac, this is a result of Browserify's compilation step opening up a
large number of npm modules all at once. You'll have to increase the maximum
number of open files allowed on your system:

    $ sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=20480
