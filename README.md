## Overview

FilePizza enables private and much faster P2P file transfer over the web.

By using web protocol [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org), we eliminate the slow and costly initial upload step traditionally required when sharing files via Dropbox/CloudApp/etc. For most files, this is a big deal. Instead of first sending the file to an external server, the sender immediately gets a link they can distribute. And when a recipient clicks it, they connect directly to the senderâ€™s computer to complete the download, eliminating the server middleman. Because the file is never actually saved on, or even touches, our servers, the transfer is incredibly private and secure.
